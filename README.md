# 🔐 CipherForge

A 5-phase encryption algorithm built from scratch in Python.📋 DescriptionCipherForge is an educational encryption system that demonstrates how real-world encryption algorithms like AES work. It applies 5 layers of transformation to convert plaintext into unreadable ciphertext.✨ Features5-phase encryption pipelineWeb interface for easy encryption/decryptionKey-based security with trillions of combinationsAutomated test suite for verification🔧 The 5 phasesPhaseNameDescription1SubstitutionShifts all characters by a fixed amount2TranspositionReverses characters in blocks3Key-DependentUses password for variable shifting4Noise InjectionAdds decoy characters5Wild Card reverse the code into other text and keys to make it harder for the code to be solved Which gives billions amount of possibilities for the code to be solved. . 🚀 Getting StartedRun in CodespacesClick Code → Codespaces → Create codespaceWait for environment to loadRun: python app.pyOpen the Ports tab and click the globe icon for port 5000Run Testspython test_engine.py

🔑 Key FormatThe encryption key is a dictionary with these fields:key = {
"shift": 5, # Phase 1: shift amount (1-94)
"block_size": 4, # Phase 2: block size (2-20)
"password": "SECRET", # Phase 3: encryption password
"noise_interval": 3, # Phase 4: insert noise every N chars
"noise_char": "~" # Phase 4: noise character to insert
}
